    "Write a program to simulate the playing of a casino game known as Jackpot for 100 persons. On each attempt, a set of three letters will be generated from a collection of seven letters \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\" and \"G\" randomly. Each attempt costs **1** dollar. If the three letters generated are consecutively \"A\" or \"B\" (i.e. either \"AAA\" or \"BBB\"), the player wins **50** dollars. Your program has to perform the following:\n",
    "- Prompt for an input of the number of attempts _N_ (which corresponds to the number of times of playing the Jackpot for each person).\n",
    "- Save the net amount won or lost accumulated at the end of _N_ attempts for each person.\n",
    "- Plot a histogram of the net amount won or lost for all 100 persons (there is no fixed value for the bins as it depends on the range of the data; set between 10 and 20). \n",
    "- Compute the expected (mean) winning or loss for each person.\n",

    "(**Hint:** You may consider using a nested loop over 100 persons over _N_ attempts, with each attempt having a 3-letter sequence generated randomly. Compare the 3-letter sequence generated with the winning letters and update the amount won or lost for each attempt. Reset the 3-letter sequence before the next attempt. Append the net amount won or lost for each person after _N_ attempts to a list. Reset the net amount before simulating the next person.)\n",
